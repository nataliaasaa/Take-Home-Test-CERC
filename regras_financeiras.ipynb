    "\n",
    "* A current ratio measures a company’s ability to cover short-term liabilities with its current assets. The formula for calculating the current ratio is: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities. Current ratios are the most inclusive of the three formulas, as they account for assets that may be harder to convert into cash. As a result, they provide a “best-case” view of your company’s liquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A quick ratio measures a company’s ability to cover short-term liabilities with its quick assets—those that can be quickly converted into cash. These typically include money at hand, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. The formula for calculating a quick ratio is: Quick Ratio = (Cash + Short-Term Investments + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities. Quick ratios exclude assets that can’t be readily converted, such as your business’s inventory. By omitting these asset types, quick ratios provide a more conservative assessment than current ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A cash ratio measures a business’s ability to cover short-term liabilities with cash. The formula for calculating it is: Cash Ratio = (Cash + Short-Term Investments) / Current Liabilities. It considers only cash and short-term investments, making it the most conservative liquidity measure. This ratio helps analysts measure liquidity in \"worst-case\" scenarios when a company must quickly pay off short-term debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any liquidity ratio above one is usually considered healthy, as it indicates that your company has enough short-term assets to cover your immediate obligations while maintaining a financial cushion. In most cases, the higher the liquidity ratio, the better.\n",

    "Leverage ratios assess the ability of a company, institution, or individual to meet their financial obligations. Carrying too much debt can be dangerous for a company and its investors, but the debt may help fuel growth if a company’s operations can generate a higher rate of return than the interest rate on its loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The debt ratio reveals how much of the assets of the company can be debt-financed rather than equity-financed. The debt ratio measures how well management can utilize working capital and the debt management capabilities of any company. Companies with a lower debt ratio can opt for more debt capital even if unexpected adverse events arise. Debt ratio = Total Debt/Total Assets\n",
    "\n",
    "* The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is perhaps the most well-known financial leverage ratio. It's expressed as: Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Total Shareholders’ Equity, it reveals how much debt a company is using compared to how much stock is outstanding (equity). A high debt/equity ratio generally indicates that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt. This can result in volatile earnings as a result of the additional interest expense. It may increase the company's chances of default or bankruptcy if the company's interest expense grows too high.\n",
